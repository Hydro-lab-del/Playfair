# Playfair Cipher Project

This project implements the Playfair cipher, a classical encryption technique, with a modern web interface. The application allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a Playfair cipher matrix generated from a custom key.

## Features

- **Matrix Generation**: Generate a 5x5 Playfair cipher matrix based on a user-provided key.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Toggle between encryption and decryption modes.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface for inputting text, keys, and viewing results.

## Files

- `playfair.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web application.
- `playfair.css`: Stylesheet for the application, providing a clean and modern look.
- `playfair.js`: JavaScript logic for matrix generation, encryption, decryption, and UI interactions.

## How to Use

1. Open `playfair.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter a key in the "Key" input field and click "Generate Matrix".
3. Enter text in the "Plaintext" or "Ciphertext" field.
4. Use the toggle switch to select "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" mode.
5. Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to process the text.
6. View the result in the "Output" section.

## Example

- **Key**: `HELLO`
- **Plaintext**: `HELLO WORLD`
- **Ciphertext**: `KDMNQ XNQME`

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
